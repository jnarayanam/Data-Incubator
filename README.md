Data and the details
--------------------

The data for this project was downloaded from [Coursera Course
website](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)
and English files are used for this analysis. This data is collected
from social media (twitter, blogs and news) and provided by the
Coursera. I thought this is optimal to start working on this "Next Word
Prediciton project" as it is completely unstructured. This data contains
a 100 million word corpus and I strongly believe this would serve as a
right data set to work on this project. For this exploratory analysis
only a small portion of the data has been taken (1% or random sample of
all three files). The data files can be found in the "Data folder" in
this repository.

### Exploratory Analysis

The details of exploration analysis can be found in the repository,
including code and figures.
